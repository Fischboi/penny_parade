# Penny Parade
Welcome!

This is just a fun little mod with a few new items centering around the idea of the already existing crooked penny item from Isaac.

I always love the risk of using crooked penny so I thought I could expand on the idea a bit more.

Feel free to use any parts of my code as reference for your own project, just be a decent human being and dont steal anyones ideas, we good? great.

Other than that, sorry for the messy code, it just be like that.
